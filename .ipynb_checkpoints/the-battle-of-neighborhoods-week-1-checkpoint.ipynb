We would like to provide targeted information near property to sold for real estate agents. We would also cluster and categorise living areas to quicly tell in which category of property belongs and what are unique charasteristics of that area for example good parks and cafeterias. This makes difference when agent has sales meeting with owner. This information can be even crucial when families deciding where they are going to move and buy new home. \n",
